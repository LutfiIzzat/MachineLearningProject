DEADLINE
The submission deadline for all components is 12:00 noon on Monday, 20 February 2024 (Study Week #2).
Deadline extension is unlikely.
GROUPING
This coursework assignment is a collaborative effort for groups of three to four students, with marks
assigned based on individual contributions.

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
The minimum requirements of the Lab Exercises Enhancements are:
• Select at least 4 labs and add further materials to it so that future students of those lab materials
can use them to have deeper understanding of the materials.
• Possible enhancements are:
o To clarify certain concepts already presented.
o To explore more advanced concept of the lab materials.
o To provide visualizations to aid deeper understanding of the lab materials.
o To apply the materials to real-world datasets to further demonstrate how those materials
can be used.
o To compare different between the various methods, approaches, or models.
o To demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of various methods, approaches, or
models.

• Do not include the original lab materials unless you need to reuse some of the original codes and
materials.
• Put each of the lab exercises enhancements in one Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb extension), meaning
you should have at least 4 Jupyter Notebooks.
• Your Jupyter Notebooks must be executable in Google Colab AND Visual Studio Code with
Jupyter Extension without the need of other codes.
The minimum requirements of the Project are:
• Select an interesting real-world problem or issue in Malaysia to be explored and analyzed to gain
further understanding of the patterns or trends.
• Select open datasets freely available in Malaysia to achieve your goals. You may choose more
than one dataset. The datasets must contain data up to year 2019 or later.
• Analyze, explore and visualize possible patterns and trends in the data.
• Make appropriate use of Principle Component Analysis in your analysis.
• Analyze and create suitable machine learning models to assist you to do predictions of the
patterns or trends.
• Explain and justify why the predictions are useful and important.
• Evaluate and assess the quality of the models and predictions.
• Make recommendations on how to your analysis can help in solving the selected problems.

DELIVERABLES
Your submissions must include:
• Jupyter Notebooks
o In your submission, you should have folders for your project submission with the naming convention
as shown in the example below:
1_LabEnhancements_PCA
2_LabEnhancements_LinearRegression
3_LabEnhancements_LogisticRegression
4_LabEnhancements_NeuralNetworks
5_Project

o The numbering should reflect the sequence that reflects the complexity of the topics.
o Make sure you do one clean run for each of the Jupyter Notebooks so that the output of the
codes are embedded into the notebooks.

• Documentations
o Your root folder should also contain a README.md in markdown format to describe the overview of
your project submissions and the folder structures.
o In each of the folders, you must also include a README.md in markdown format to give an
overview of the particular lab enhancement or project.
o State the full official student names (as registered at MMU) and student IDs, and state each
member’s contribution clearly.
o Cite all references and data sources etc. within the Jupyter Notebooks.
• Video Presentation
o Prepare a video recording of not more than 15 minutes explaining all your submissions.
o You are free to choose whatever presentation format, each member of the group must participate
in the presentation.
o Upload your presentation as a private video on YouTube, and share the link in the documentations.

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
Put all your files in GitHub and share with me the link in a Google Form to be made available later.
Only one member of each group needs to submit the GitHub link in the Google Form.
Make sure you put your GitHub repository as private and add my GitHub ID (ypwong@mmu.edu.my) as
your collaborator. Apply for a GitHub Education student account immediately if you have not done so.
